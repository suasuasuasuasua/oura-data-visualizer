# Oura Data Visualizer

My alternative data visualization tool for the Oura ring.

## Idea

I want to learn more about iOS development, and what better way is there than to
code up an app that already exists? Jokes aside, while the Oura app is already
quite good, I think that it would be cool to handle the data and be able to see
exactly what I want to see.
